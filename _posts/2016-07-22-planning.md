# Planning
![We've planned the 22 days of our trip on a spreadsheet](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b74cc1a590fa0331b57bfa52e2b4cc04/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=960&cropwidth=1280&degrees=-180&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F64c95b00-f35d-42c2-9fe3-a4edc9ee6bb6.jpg&x=0&y=0)

It all started when our son invited us to visit his family in Montana this summer. We talked about driving. Then we talked about what we might see on the way.

By the time we finished planning the trip, we had scheduled ourselves to see 12 different National Park Service properties during a three week 6,000 mile loop around America.

Yeah, I'm fired up.
