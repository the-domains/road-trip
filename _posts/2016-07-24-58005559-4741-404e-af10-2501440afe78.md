# ViewRanger
![The map shows where we walked ](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b2a61f39-89e5-4528-abfb-19288d0ab149.jpg)

I've installed Viewranger on my phone, and I'm learning to use it to record our hikes. We started with 2.8 miles yesterday.

This morning our walk was shorter, just 1.8 miles. Our thinking is that whatever we walk in the humid South, we'll be able to walk further where it's drier.
