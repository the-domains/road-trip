# Oak Mountain

We have much to learn. We tried to use AllTrails to guide us on the Blue Trail in Oak Mountain State Park. The trail is classified as "hard," so we were glad we were able to make it okay.

We didn't walk the whole length of it, but we did hike the toughest 2+ miles of it and then turned around and repeated the exercise.

All in all, a good day. Worked up a royal sweat, had a good time, and avoided injury. The old people's hiking trifecta.
